Victoria: As humans, we are always finding scope to grow. We want better. More. We want to be stronger. Smarter. Connected. We want to explore further, delve deeper and reach higher. We want to tiptoe the border between reality and impossibility, between technology and science-fiction. But where is this border? Does this border even exist? And more importantly, should we keep pushing these boundaries just because we can? This is Limitless, Part 1.

My name’s Victoria Ruming, and I am on the Education team at Women in Technology from the University of New South Wales.

Vivian W: And my name is Vivian Wong. I am the Education executive of Women in Technology. In this episode of Talk WIT Us, we will be exploring the limits of technology, in which we will attempt to distinguish the difference between how far we can and should go in terms of technological development.

Victoria: Firstly, what determines the limits of technological advancement. The laws of physics? Resources? How about our own creativity? Are our technological limits all in our head? Human creativity is the driving force of innovation since it is crucial for adaptive and unique thinking. It is our most powerful tool when it comes to problem-solving, innovation and even effective communication. But are there any factors that limit our creativity?

Vivian W: That’s Alyse Sue. Alyse is a software engineer, a board member of Singularity U Australia, and a cofounder of Transhumanism Australia. She believes creativity is innately human, yet as we age, the society around us plays a huge role in how we cultivate or suppress our creative thinking and tendencies.

Victoria: But maybe our fundamental creativity is not the issue. Maybe what is being limited is our ability to communicate our creativity.

Either way, creativity is potentially a huge hurdle when it comes to technological advancement. We only know what we have seen. We can’t imagine new colours. When we communicate, we are merely using lists of words we have heard before. When we innovate, we are twisting and combining concepts we have seen in the past.

Vivian W: But as we look towards the future, will the value of creativity change with its context? One day, we may be able to side-step issues regarding communication through thought-transfer technology, where we may be able to share our direct thoughts before they are lost in translation. Additionally, as AI become more and more advanced, will it become possible to use machines to enhance our creativity?

Victoria: On the other hand, it may be possible that creativity isn’t our limiting factor at all.

So, assuming we have full creative freedom to do whatever we want with technology… then what?

Vivian W: Before we go on, we will have to define transhumanism. Transhumanism is overcoming the limits of human biology using science and technology, allowing us to evolve beyond our current physical and mental limitations. In many ways, transhumanism is a part of what we envision when we think of futuristic technology. Among many other things, the field incorporates gene editing, brain implants, exoskeletons and Artificial General Intelligence (or AGI for short). In particular, AGI is a topic widely discussed in the scientific community.

Victoria: The typical AI we have today are capable of completing very specific tasks by learning and updating their decisions based on external stimulus. A good example is the AlphaZero AI, a machine capable of beating even its own creator in chess. However, if you were to tell this AI to complete an unrelated task, such as update your grocery list, it will fail miserably. AGI is different. AGI is the hypothetical intelligence of machine which allows it to learn or respond to stimulus just like a human can. It is the kind of AI we will see in science-fiction books and movies.

Vivian W: And of course, there are many other topics broadly discussed in the transhumanism community.

Now that we have delved a little deeper into the potential technologies associated with transhumanism, we can start to question whether or not we are doing the right thing by pursuing this technology. What are the ethical concerns? What are our fears? Are these reasons to stop our pursuit.
When I think of controversial technology, I think of AGI. Many people seem to be unsettled by the thought of AGI, the technology which may be capable of exceeding the mental limitations of the human race. And in many ways, this fear is warranted; we will naturally fear the things that we cannot surpass. And we will fear the things we don’t understand. Alyse also recognises the negatives associated with AGI. But she is also a firm believer that a lot of good can come from this technology.

Vivian W: But what about the kind of fears we see in science-fiction? Is it possible that AGI becomes too powerful? Can AGI destroy us?

Instead of envisioning the dystopian worlds we see in Black Mirror, Alyse views the ethics of transhumanistic technology in a different light

Victoria: Considering these ethical issues, as well as the fears many people share about AGI and Transhumanistic technology, will it be wise to keep pushing the boundaries of innovation? Just because we can, does that mean we should?

Before talking with Alyse, there was one possibility I did not think of. And that was, could it be that we are doing the wrong thing by not injecting more resources into transhumanistic technology?

Vivian W: And what about women in STEM? How will we be impacted by transhumanistic technology?

Victoria: Whether or not we are fond of transhumanism and AGI, research into such topics is here to stay. At what rate this will occur we can never say for sure. We also do not know if we will ever reach our full technological potential. But maybe one day, we will truly push the definition of what it means to be human. And what will the consequences be? I suppose we’ll just have to find out.
